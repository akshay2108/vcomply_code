# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I am excited to submit a working demo of the File Explorer application, as per the requirements you specified. I have followed the necessary steps to run the application locally, and the code has been designed to be easy to read and understand.
Instructions to Run the Application Locally:
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.
Download the Code:
Download the code from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/AkshayNeela/vcomply-code
Install Dependencies:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the application.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
npm install
Run the Application:
After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the application:
npm start
Access the File Explorer:
Once the application is running, open your web browser and visit: http://localhost:3000 to access the File Explorer.
Code Readability and Structure:
The code for the File Explorer application has been developed using React.js and Material-UI icons. The React components have been structured for easy comprehension and maintainability. The FileNode component represents a node in the file explorer tree and manages functionalities like toggling, renaming, creating folders, and creating files.
The main App component initializes the initial file structure and handles state management with useState Hook for the file explorer. It includes functions to delete, create, and rename nodes in the file structure.
Additional Notes:
The file explorer allows users to navigate through folders, view files, create folders, create files, rename nodes, and delete nodes.
When creating or renaming nodes, the application validates input to ensure valid names are provided.
The file structure is represented as a tree data structure, making it easy to manage and modify the directory structure.
Please feel free to test the application locally, and if you have any feedback or questions, I would be more than happy to address them.
Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss further how my skills and experience can contribute to the success of vcomply.
